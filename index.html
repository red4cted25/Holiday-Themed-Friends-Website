        <h2>Meet the Meat-Like Appendages group!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our holiday website! We created this as a place for our circle of friends to share our cherished holiday memories, previous events, and to be able to help with events such as White Elephant! Here you can get to know us all better through photos, bios, and stories of our holiday celebrations over the years. Feel free to poke around the site using the navigation bar above. The gallery has some favorite snapshots from past shared holidays and parties. And in the spirit of the season, we invite you to share any holiday wishes or gift ideas on our wishlist form. We hope you enjoy virtually celebrating the season with our friends group! Wishing you happy holidays and a wonderful new year!</p>
